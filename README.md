# CISC3130 Lab1: Hello-World
### This repo holds a simple HTML page with a hint of CSS and JavaScript in it.
---
There are no packages needs to be installed to run the contents of this repo, since, as I already mentioned, this is a simple HTML page.  
But since the lab requires us to put a simple description here, I will tell you how to download stuff from GitHub and how to open a static HTML page:

1. While you are in the home directory of this repo, press on the green "Code" button in the top right corner.
2. You will be prompted to copy an SSH or HTTPS URL to clone this repo to your local machine(I personally prefer to clone over SSH, because it's more secure).
3. After you got that URL, go to the terminal on your local machine(I will assume you are not a crazy person and not using Windows computer for programming) and run the following command: 
```zsh
git clone *PASTE THE LINK HERE*
```
4. It should not tale long to copy all the files to your computer, since this is a very lightweight repo, so after it's done cd to the newly created folder by running: 
```zsh 
cd Hello-World
```  
5. When you are inside of the Hello-World directory, run the following command: 
```zsh
open index.html
``` 
And voila, a beautiful creature of mine will appear in your default browser.
